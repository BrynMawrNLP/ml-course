## Pre-assignment material

#### Pre-course survey (2 points)

Please fill out this short [survey](https://forms.gle/CHnSTiwY26BAiyUK6).
Your answers will help your instructor get to know you and learn what you hope to get out of this course. This will help me modify the course to best fit your interests.

#### Growth mindset (5 points)
Watch the following 10-minute video about a growth-mindset.

<div style="max-width:854px"><div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve" width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

<br><br><br>
Then, in a file called `GROWTH.txt`, define what a 'growth mindset' means to you in your own words. Then, explain how you intend to apply this concept in our class throughout the semester. 
How do you think adopting a growth mindset can benefit your learning and performance in this course?

## Overview

The goal of this assignment is to implement a supervised machine learning algorithm (in this case K-nearest neighbors) and apply it to a real dataset. Along the way you should familiarize yourself with some of the terminology we have been discussing in class. You will also get a chance to practice working with large datasets (and practice Python if it has been a while).

## 1. Look at the data

The data for HW01 is a set of handwritten digits from zip codes written on hand-addressed letters. The dataset is separated into `train` and `test`, and is available here:

```
/home/apoliak/Public/ml-course/hw01/train.zip
/home/apoliak/Public/ml-course/hw01/test.zip
```

Read about this dataset by going to the Elements of Statistical Learning website, <a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/">ESL</a>, then clicking on the “Data” tab, then clicking on the “Info” for the zip code dataset. It is similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database">MNIST dataset</a> (examples shown below):

![](hw01/rmnist_10.png)

Use the command `less` in the terminal to view the beginning of each file. Both datasets have the same format: the first column is the “label” (here an integer between 0 and 9, inclusive, that corresponds to the identity of a hand-written zip code digit), and the rest of each row is made up of gray-scale values corresponding to the image of this hand-written digit.

## 2. Reading in data

One useful technique is to load a dataset from a file into a numpy array. Here is an example:

```
import numpy as np
train_data = np.loadtxt("path/to/train/file")
```

In the file knn.py (create this file if you’re on the waitlist), 
Add this functionality to test this approach by printing train_data. Make sure the data format makes sense. You can also import the test data in this way. After you load the data, print the shape. The shape of a numpy array represents the dimensions. What is the shape of the training data? Of the testing data?

```
print(train_data.shape)
print(test_data.shape)
``` 

## 3. Distance function
An important part of many machine learning methods is the concept of `distance` between examples. We often phrase this as a `metric` on our inputs. Implement the method called `distance` that takes as input two examples (any two examples, although in this case we’ll use it with one test and one train), and outputs the distance (we’ll use Euclidean for now) between them. Although there are many built-in functions the perform this task, please implement your distance function from scratch. However, you are welcome to use numpy functions as part of it (for example, you may use np.sum and similar functions, but look up how they work first).

## 4. Classification
Create a function that takes as input one test example and an integer k, and outputs a prediction based on a nearest-neighbor classifier. This function will loop through all the training examples, find the distance between each one and the input test example, and then find the K nearest neighbors (you are welcome to use numpy sorting methods, but look up how they work first). For this subroutine, we’ll need a distance function.

## FAQ

**How do I know if my code is working?**  
Run the provided unit tests provided in [tests.py]().
Initially, many of them will fail. 
If your program is working correctly, all of them will pass. However, the converse is not true: passing all the tests is not sufficient to demonstrate that your code is working. 
*Using tests.py is strongly encouraged, this is similar to how your code will be graded on gradescope.*

## README.md

In a text file called `README.md` answer the following questions:

1. How much time did you spend on the homework
1. What did you learn from this homework
1. optional: What did you struggle with during this homework
1. optional: any other feedback you would like to share

## Submitting

Submit the following files to the assignment called `HW01` on Gradescope:

1. `knn.py`
2. `README.md` 

Make sure to name these files exactly what we specify here. Otherwise,
our autograders might not work and we might have to take points off.
